This library wraps the Location APIs in Kotlin coroutines and `Flow`.

# Usage

Create a `CoLocation` or `CoGeocoding` instance, preferably by using a dependency injection framework. `CoLocation` is
very similar to the classes provided by the Location APIs. Instead of `LocationServices.getFusedLocationProviderClient(context).lastLocation`
you can use `coLocation.getLastLocation()`. Make sure to have the Location permission from Marshmallow on, if they are
needed by your API requests.

Example:

```kotlin
val coLocation = CoLocation.from(context);
val coGeocoder = CoGeocoder.from(context);

val locationRequest = LocationRequest.create()
        .setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY)
        .setInterval(5000)

val locationUpdates: MutableLiveData<Location> = MutableLiveData()
val addressUpdates: LiveData<Address?> = locationUpdates.switchMap { location ->
        liveData { emit(coGeocoder.getAddressFromLocation(location)) }
    }

val job = viewModelScope.launch {
    try {
        coLocation.getLocationUpdates(locationRequest).collect(mutableLocationUpdates::postValue)
    } catch (e: CancellationException) {
        // Location updates cancelled
    }
}

// The updates get canceled automatically when viewModelScope is cancelled.
// If you want to cancel it before that, save the job and cancel it.
job.cancel()
```

The following APIs are wrapped by this library:

* `FusedLocationProviderClient` via `CoLocation`
* `SettingsClient` via `CoLocation`
* `Geocoder` via `CoGeocoder`

Checking the location settings is simplified with this library, by providing a `SettingsResult` via
`coLocation.checkLocationSettings(locationRequest)`:

```kotlin
val settingsResult = coLocation.checkLocationSettings(locationRequest)

when (settingsResult) {
    SettingsResult.Satisfied -> startLocationUpdates()
    is SettingsResult.Resolvable -> settingsResult.resolve(activity, REQUEST_SHOW_SETTINGS)
    else -> { /* Ignore for now, we can't resolve this anyway */ }
}

override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
    if (requestCode == REQUEST_SHOW_SETTINGS && resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
        // Resolution success, location settings are now satisfied
        startLocationUpdates()
    }
}
```

# Sample

A basic sample app is available in the `sample` project.

# Testing

When unit testing your app's classes, `CoLocation` and `CoGeocoder` behavior can be mocked easily. See
`MainViewModelTest` in the `sample` project for an example test.
